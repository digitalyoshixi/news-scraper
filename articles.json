Making it free could greatly expand its user base, and it could also make it more popular in the long run because learners could start with it without having to pay an annual fee, and some learners go pro.It's also good news for some macOS developers, as Microsoft not long ago chose to end support for Visual Studio on that platform. Yes, you can use VS Code, Xcode, or other options, but there were some types of projects that were left in the lurch, especially for developers who don't find VS Code robust enough for their purposes.There is one drawback that might matter to some: users working in Rider on the non-commercial free license \"cannot opt out of the collection of anonymous usage statistics.\"There are some edge cases that are in a bit of a gray area when it comes to using a free license versus a paid one. Sometimes, projects that start without commercial intent can become commercial later on.
