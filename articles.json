For decades, if you went to a travel website, whether it\u2019s Expedia, or this or that, you\u2019d have the same exact search experience as someone else. It\u2019s not personalized to you, and we think travel should be more personalized. We have a whole bunch of features and upgrades that really personalize the search experience based on the past bookings you\u2019ve done and what we know about your profile."]], [["So those are the basic things we\u2019ve done: 70 upgrades. The final thing I\u2019ll say is these 70 upgrades are 70 out of 430 upgrades that we\u2019ve made over the last two years. So I think this system of launching has really accelerated product development at Airbnb."]], [["I want to come back to the product development cycle. You do it all very differently, but I want to stay on the Co-Host Network for one second. That is professionalizing a huge portion of Airbnb. I know some professional hosts and management companies who do other properties. Their point of view is, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to find us. We\u2019ll market to people who own properties, and then we\u2019ll put you on every platform.\u201d You\u2019re going to do all the discovery of finding a co-host, and then negotiate a cut, and then handling the splits on your platform?"]], [["Yes."]], [["Is that to just bring a more professional class of management companies directly into Airbnb?"]], [["No. Actually, let me break this down. So, there\u2019s a lot of third-party, professional property management companies. If you\u2019re a third-party company, you don\u2019t want to have a business with just managing five people, building your own website, and building your own demand for five people, for five properties. You tend to need economies of scale, so you\u2019re going to be managing hundreds of properties, even thousands of properties.\u00a0"]], [["If you manage thousands of properties, now you have a whole bunch of employees. Then, you probably have a company name, and your employees probably wear a T-shirt with a company name on the T-shirt. This is basically just a little more of an industrial hospitality experience.\u00a0"]], [["Someone might argue that it\u2019s a little more like a hotel. There can be pluses to that from a service standpoint, but for a lot of people, this is a little bit different than the original ethos of Airbnb of \u201cliving like a local.\u201d"]], [["Number one, every single co-host is vetted by Airbnb. We go through everyone\u2019s profile. We only allow people who have high ratings in Airbnb to be co-hosts, so these are the very best hosts in Airbnb. Additionally, we bias towards people that manage only a few properties. The reason why is we noticed that the more properties you manage, the lower the five-star rating after a certain scale. There are some property managers who are amazing and defy this, but generally speaking, hospitality is a difficult thing to industrialize. People want a local feel, as compared to Amazon, delivery, or other types of businesses where scale makes the service better. Hospitality at scale often makes the service more challenging.\u00a0"]], [["I think this is maybe an alternative to the extremely professionalized third-party property managers, and in some ways, it kind of moves Airbnb a little closer toward the roots. Again, I think we\u2019re going to bias towards more regular people putting up their real homes, rather than more dedicated rentals. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re going.\u00a0"]], [["Now, just one caveat. If anyone\u2019s listening and they work at or are a third-party property manager, we love the ones guests love. Although the average rating across the board isn\u2019t as high, there are some unbelievable property managers, and we love them."]], [["The last point I\u2019ll just make: it is true property managers are more likely to \u2014 you might call it cross-list. They\u2019ll cross-list their inventory on many different platforms. One of the core values of Airbnb is that you come to Airbnb to find something you can\u2019t find anywhere else. If you can find it everywhere else, then we\u2019re just another e-commerce platform, and we\u2019re not adding a lot of value. So the co-hosts on Airbnb are exclusive, and those properties are exclusive to Airbnb."]], [["One of the reasons I always like talking to you is that Airbnb has all of the challenges of\u2026 I don\u2019t know, an internet video platform? It\u2019s a platform of suppliers and audiences, but then you\u2019re managing this very physical thing that seems very challenging."]], [["Here\u2019s the thing people don\u2019t realize. Airbnb is a harder business to run than it appears. Apple does not appear to be an easy business because one device is like a miracle in your hand. OpenAI doesn\u2019t appear to be an easy business. But Airbnb does. The reason Airbnb appears to be an easy business is because, at a sub-scale, it is an easy business. If you wanted to just find a home in Croatia, you don\u2019t even need a website. You can just get a friend, and you can get a house."]], [["The part that makes Airbnb hard is that there are 4 million people per night from nearly every country in the world \u2014\u00a0 more countries than Coca-Cola operates in \u2014 living together. That\u2019s the part that makes it hard: the scale. And the scale is the only way you can actually do this profitably, or very, very profitably, as well. That\u2019s the part that makes it really difficult.\u00a0"]], [["I remember\u2026 I think it was Doug Leone from Sequoia Capital (this was like 10 years ago). He came to my office and he said, \u201cYou have the hardest business of any of the Sequoia portfolio companies to run. First of all, you have to have a mobile app, and you need a website.\u201d This is when Uber only had a mobile app. \u201cSo you need to be on every platform. You need to be in every country in the world, but you need supply and demand, and they\u2019re not in the same city.\u201d Uber could go one city at a time; they can get riders and drivers in one city. We had to get supply everywhere and demand everywhere, and perfectly match the corridors. It is highly regulated \u2014\u00a0 as regulated as Uber, probably even more regulated in many ways. The hotel commissions and the hotel trade councils are significantly more powerful than the taxi unions. So this is a very, very difficult business."]], [["We\u2019re handling a lot of money through the platform: over $90 billion a year, which is the GDP of Croatia. We have to deal with physical safety, and more types of physical safety than even ridesharing because of a myriad of things. Obviously, there are a lot of accidental issues that can occur. You have to deal with some of the hardest customer service challenges you can imagine. Somebody checks in at 11PM in Paris. They\u2019re from Tokyo, they don\u2019t speak French, and the host isn\u2019t responsive, so they have to call customer service. You start to think about how you have to manage the quality of supply that you don\u2019t actually own or control. But you have to influence the quality, and you\u2019re competing with an alternative supply that has a front desk. By the way, I could keep going on and on\u2026"]], [["Or a search problem. People think that Google\u2019s got one of the hardest search problems, and Airbnb\u2019s got a more pedestrian search problem. I\u2019m not saying we have search technology like Google, but here\u2019s the difference: you type something in Google, but when\u2019s the last time you needed to look at a third page of Google? The first five results are the only five results you need. If you\u2019re typing in \u201cParis\u201d and you need a house, we have 150,000 homes. Suddenly, this is a matching problem, not just a search relevancy problem where there\u2019s just one right answer. So it is a harder business than meets the eye, and that\u2019s just our core business.

So how would I game TikTok? How would I game YouTube? How do bad actors use those platforms? It seems like you have a lot of those same challenges."]], [["It\u2019s a cat and mouse game. It is so challenging. I\u2019ll give you an example of something we found. There was an entire industry of companies that emerged \u2014 that we caught, and we stopped them \u2014 that were advertising that they can get your bad reviews taken down. They knew how to call customer service, and what to say to get your negative reviews taken down. That became not only a fraudulent activity, it became an industry. There were entire companies built around doing this.\u00a0"]], [["Of course, that is fraudulent, so you have to stop that stuff, but the thing that makes Airbnb so difficult in this way \u2014 and probably more difficult than, say, a video platform \u2014 is its longer tail. On YouTube, people can game things, but generally, a disproportionate number of views go to certain videos. For Airbnb, that\u2019s not possible. Only one person can stay at the house at a time, or one family can stay at a time. It\u2019s a long tail, and it\u2019s in nearly every country. So, there are a lot of different schemes that can occur."]], [["The reason I brought that up in the context of Co-Host Network is that it seems like professionalizing or certifying that class of user on Airbnb goes a long way toward ending some of the gamification that occurs in the platform."]], [["Hundred percent. To maybe oversimplify one of the trends that we\u2019re doing at Airbnb, we are managing more of the inventory and verifying more of the users at the simplest level. It\u2019s really important to understand the history of where it even came from."]], [["Starting Airbnb was in the context of eBay and Craigslist. In fact, I think when I started Airbnb with my two friends, eBay\u2019s market cap might\u2019ve been higher than Amazon. It wasn\u2019t obvious Amazon was going to be the winner. It kind of really pulled away, but eBay was the marketplace, and Craigslist was how most people found housing. It was completely the Wild West. It pretty much still is today. There was really no management of inventory."]], [["We thought about how the internet is like an immune system, and what you should do is give communities tools to moderate themselves: so flags, reports of suspicious behavior, but, most importantly, a review system. We built this really powerful review system where about two out of three people, after they book an Airbnb, leave a review., and two out of three hosts leave a review. We thought, \u201cOh, this is great.\u201d It turns out that is necessary, but not sufficient. So over time, we\u2019ve been in the business of managing more and more of the quality ourselves. We\u2019re very hands-on with quality control. Most new services we actually vet and certify ourselves. We think reviews are important, but we don\u2019t want to put the entire burden on the user base.\u00a0"]], [["Again, there\u2019s a lot of ways to game things, so you\u2019ve got to be very hands-on. But the more things you verify, the more things you inspect, the more things you certify, the fewer areas there will be to exploit a company."]], [["Let me put that right next to the platforms. Forgive me, but we\u2019re however many days away from the election, and the thing I see with all of the major social networks right now is that they\u2019re doing less moderation."]], [["Yes."]], [["They\u2019re less interested in verifying things are true or false, or even that people are real and not AI. You just see it all over the place, they\u2019ve taken their hands off. Airbnb\u2019s platform, you\u2019re saying, \u201cWe\u2019re doing more, we\u2019re certifying more things.\u201d When you sign up and you want to rent the room in your house while you\u2019re gone on vacation, here\u2019s a list of approved co-hosts. Here\u2019s experiences that we\u2019re designing with professional designers.\u201d Why the difference? Why is it all the other platforms are letting go, and you\u2019re grabbing on tighter?"]], [["I have a theory that I\u2019ll share. In our business, it\u2019s obvious what the customer wants. The customer wants more moderation. They just do. I never heard a customer say, \u201cYou are controlling the inventory too much. You are removing too many bad listings. You are penalizing hosts that are making me unhappy.\u201d They actually call and say the opposite, like, \u201cHow dare you.\u201d They get very upset and personal when a home doesn\u2019t work out, even if it\u2019s not our home. We\u2019re just the platform. So we are consistently held responsible by the customer for the content on our platform. So number one, the customer is expecting this."]], [["Number two, the economic incentives are very clear. This is not an advertising platform where the product and the business model are separate from an aligned interest standpoint \u2014\u00a0 they\u2019re completely connected. You can start to see a bad Airbnb, and people then don\u2019t rebook on Airbnb, they don\u2019t come back. So there\u2019s a really clear economic incentive."]], [["The last thing is Airbnbs are just not that politicized. People just want to have good vacations. You don\u2019t have the myriad of political issues and baggage. I think when it comes to platforms like X, YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok, it\u2019s not clear what the customer\u2019s asking for. On the one hand, users want veracity of information, but on the other hand, I think they\u2019re very skeptical of the hand that platforms are putting on the product \u2014\u00a0 in our case, they\u2019re not."]], [["I think that we\u2019re going to look back at history, and the platforms that are going to be most successful are going to be the ones that have the greatest truth and veracity of information. And veracity of information starts with, \u201cAre these people real? Are they not real?\u201d I remember emailing [Elon Musk] when he first acquired Twitter, and I gave unsolicited advice, which was that you should verify 100 percent of the users on Twitter. They decided not to do that, and I didn\u2019t even really have a conversation with him."]], [["They did almost the opposite, actually."]], [["Yeah, but I would\u2019ve done that. I would have verified 100 percent of the users. I still think a platform that verifies every single person is a really good idea, and that\u2019s what we do right now. Now, there might be reasons not to verify, like you just want to... I don\u2019t know, maybe people are nervous about verification if they can\u2019t be whistleblowers on platforms?"]], [["But again, a lot of the reason people don\u2019t want moderation is they distrust the companies. They believe the companies are politically motivated and they\u2019re putting their thumb on a scale politically for free speech. This becomes an attack vector for politics. I think before you moderate content, you should moderate people. You should moderate not if they should be kicked off the site or allowed on the site, but are these real people? Are they who they say they are, and are they allowed to use pseudonyms or not?"]], [["I think in the speech context, there\u2019s quite a long history of debates about anonymity. We can set that aside in the context of Airbnb, but it\u2019s interesting how the platform is expressed in atoms for you and bits for them, which result in very different incentives."]], [["Totally."]], [["The part where you\u2019re taking more control of the experience, because you think that\u2019s perfectly aligned with the customer, at some point do you just end up with a front desk? Are you just running the hotel? It seems like that\u2019s the farthest end of that journey."]], [["I love how you think because it\u2019s good to take logical steps towards that conclusion and ask, \u201cWhere do you draw the line?\u201d I think we want to have almost all the benefits of a hotel while retaining the benefits of Airbnb. So let\u2019s just break them down."]], [["The benefit of an Airbnb is that every room and every home is different. There\u2019s no SKUs. Hotels are such commodities that you never see the room you\u2019re booking. You don\u2019t even know the floor you\u2019re booking. You book a hotel room, and you don\u2019t even know the floor you\u2019re on, let alone what view you have. By the way, it doesn\u2019t really matter because they\u2019re kind of all the same, or at least the hotel kind of trains you not to care. That is the definition of commodity. It\u2019s such a commodity that you don\u2019t even have any choice. You just choose the hotel, and you barely choose the room \u2014 maybe you choose the tier of the room."]], [["We want every space to be unique. We want every space to be one of a kind. We want our experience to be as personal as possible. Yes, there are more professional managers today than there were 10 years ago, but generally speaking, 90 percent of our hosts are still regular people. We want to feel like when you step into an Airbnb or you travel to a city, you\u2019re living like a local. So those are the things we want to retain."]], [["We really want it to be their home. We don\u2019t want to create an Airbnb aesthetic, right? I\u2019ve been asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you guys do a deal with IKEA?\u201d Well actually, that\u2019s not really what people want. They don\u2019t really want a standardization of design. They really want, when they\u2019re in Paris, to feel like they\u2019re in Paris. They don\u2019t want to feel the same as they do in Kansas City or somewhere else. But hotels start to feel more similar, especially chain hotels."]], [["But what we do want to do is match the hotel service as much as we can. There isn\u2019t a front desk, but can we create a remote front desk? Can we have more 24/7 support? Can we use AI to level the playing field of the front desk, where AI can be immediate, it can be multilingual, it can adjudicate?\u00a0"]], [["AI at least can be a frontline that can adjudicate disputes between guests and hosts better than a real person. What you can do is you can train it on the corpus of like 100 policies, and then it can look at the last 100,000 times somebody complained about this, and figure out what the most likely resolution was that led to satisfaction for both parties, You can actually train a model to spit out the right answer, and they can either directly spit out the answer as the frontline through the app to the guest and host or, if you do want to talk to a person, it can help the customer service person."]], [["So, I think we want to manage Airbnbs more before they become ours. Not even that it would be a bad business model, but I think it would start to cut into the ethos of feeling like you\u2019re living like a local and being truly authentic."]], [["Where\u2019s the last step of that? Is it just owning the property? Is it taking the booking directly?"]], [["I think that there are steps beyond this. The step beyond this that we haven\u2019t gone to is that you have to apply to list on Airbnb. We have certain quality criteria, and if you don\u2019t meet that, then you can\u2019t list on Airbnb. That\u2019s probably where we\u2019re going within our new verticals, which we\u2019re going to launch starting next year. Amazon had this moment where they were just selling books, and then in the late \u201890s, they decided to go just outside books. What\u2019s adjacent to books back in the \u201890s? DVDs and CDs, and then they went further and further. So we\u2019re going to have that Amazon moment.\u00a0"]], [["For the new verticals and categories we\u2019re launching, I believe we\u2019re going to have an apply-to-list model where you have to apply. So we\u2019re starting to have an opinion on quality. That is going to be the next step, and probably the final step. The step beyond that is actually owned and operated, and we don\u2019t own or operate anything except for these promotional listings that people might know of, which are called Icons. We built a "], ["40-foot tall Polly Pocket clamshell", "https://news.airbnb.com/polly-pocket/"], [". Yes, we own and operate that, but that\u2019s really marketing that generates a lot of views.

They wanted to be preferred suppliers to YouTube."]], [["Interesting."]], [["YouTube decided this was too big of a risk.

So there\u2019s going to be a standard to list on Airbnb, and then there\u2019s probably going to be \u2014 depending upon the vertical \u2014\u00a0 different levels of certification or quality. The quality could be based on their expertise in the real world, or it could be based on what customers are saying on Airbnb. For example, we have this designation, called \u201cguest favorite,\u201d which are 2 million of the best homes in Airbnb based on ratings, reviews, and customer service tickets. So I think we\u2019re going to do more of that and that\u2019s probably where we\u2019re going to go."]], [["I\u2019m interested to see how that plays out.\u00a0"]], [["It\u2019s all going to play out over the next 24 months."]], [["I\u2019ll give you another really dumb example. BuzzFeed designed its entire business on being the best at Facebook. And one day, Facebook was like, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t need you.

Let\u2019s take YouTube. A MrBeast video can get 100 or 200 hundred million views. You can\u2019t have a single Airbnb be that popular, so the entire marketplace is significantly more long tail. We\u2019re in 100,000 cities; no one city represents even 1 percent of our business on Airbnb."]], [["So generally, there has been this move towards a little more consolidation of inventory via professional property managers, but it\u2019s not been that much. Again, for the last four years alone, 90 percent of our hosts are individuals, and that number has remained pretty much unchanged. I think many of the new products and features we\u2019re launching are going to enable more people to allow more long-tail inventory onto the platform. That\u2019s generally where we\u2019re pushing."]], [["Does it benefit Airbnb to have less consolidated inventory on the platform? It probably does because they\u2019re less likely to cross-list.

It\u2019s another one of the economic dynamics where non-professionals sometimes have an economic advantage over professionals. This is just one example. Their homes are equipped, and the fixed cost is an investment they\u2019ve already incurred.

I didn\u2019t know how to run it, so I hired people from Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and other companies, and they brought their processes with them.\u00a0 We kind of reverted towards the way everyone runs their company. I remember that we were kind of a matrix organization with 1,000 employees, and like almost all matrix organizations, it was hard to get work done."]], [["I\u2019ll give you an example. There was a creative marketing department that would have to create graphics for different teams. Then, we kept hiring subteams that kept asking more and more from the graphics team. It was called the creative group. At some point, the creative group was like a deli, and they had these lines out the window. They just kind of threw their hands up. If you needed anything done, let\u2019s say you were a team and you needed a button designed, or a graphic for a button design, it would be like a three-month waiting list because they were inundated."]], [["So then the team said, \u201cWell, give us our own resources. Give me a dedicated creative person,\u201d and this could also be true for technology, finance, a legal team, any function. And this is when you start to divisionalize the company. Quite literally you\u2019re subdividing it. This is where the general management structure comes from. It makes a lot of sense why this happens."]], [["The problem with that, though, is that once you subdivide the company, the company starts rowing in different directions. Now, you have even more bureaucracy because the groups don\u2019t want to work together. They\u2019re incentivized to work on different things, and they might not be totally compatible anymore. Ten teams can have 10 different tech stacks, and they don\u2019t actually fit together. A local decision that might make sense for your team might not make sense for the company."]], [["The next thing is that these general managers are incentivized, typically, on output goals that you don\u2019t usually run on P&Ls. They run on impact or growth, so they have to advocate for as many resources as possible. This is what we call politics. You\u2019re advocating for yourself. So suddenly, groups start going in many different directions. Because the company\u2019s going in many different directions, oversight becomes more difficult. When oversight gets more difficult, now there\u2019s less accountability. You have people that are crappy, and there\u2019s no consequence, so that makes people feel like it doesn\u2019t matter. This is where complacency sets in. This is, I think, what ends up happening at big companies."]], [["The big thing that I said about founder mode, and this is something I\u2019ve said for four years, is it\u2019s not about... Paul Graham coined it founder mode. I think it\u2019s a good name, I think it\u2019s very catchy. I could not have made something as viral as Paul Graham. But there is a downside to the name. First of all, people don\u2019t know what founder mode is. They think it means swagger. I remember a tweet that said, \u201cI\u2019m going founder mode on this burrito.\u201d I don\u2019t know what that means. I think people think it means the founder swagger: \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck. I\u2019m going in, I\u2019m kicking ass.\u201d That\u2019s kind of what it turned into, and only founders have that."]], [["That wasn\u2019t the message. If I could summarize founder mode in a couple sentences, it\u2019s about being in the details. It\u2019s that great leadership is presence, not absence. It\u2019s about a leader being in the details. And if you as a leader aren\u2019t in the details, guess what? Your leaders aren\u2019t in the details, and their leaders aren\u2019t in the details. And one day you\u2019re going to wake up, and you have 50-year-olds managing 40-year-olds, managing 30-year-olds, managing people two years out of college doing all the work with no oversight, and you have these four unnecessary layers. You have no experts in the company."]], [["So, the antidote to this is to try to be as functional as possible. We are a functional organization. Functional just means expertise-based, not general management-based. I\u2019m the only non-functional person in the company; all functions roll up to me. I generally think the CEO should be the chief product officer of the company. The most important thing a company does is make a product. If the CEO is not the expert in the product, then why are they the CEO? Said differently, I should not be the CEO of SpaceX. I couldn\u2019t be the chief product officer because I do not understand rocketry. So maybe I\u2019m a good CEO, but I can\u2019t be the chief product officer. There may be some exceptions, but I generally think that\u2019s the case.\u00a0"]], [["Your leaders shouldn\u2019t just be \u201cmanagers\u201d (and I put managers in quotes), they should also be in the details. If we were a military, like a battalion, the cavalry general should know how to ride a horse. It\u2019s crazy that they don\u2019t. And leaders shouldn\u2019t be fungible. So it\u2019s really about being in the details."]], [["Now, here\u2019s the problem with the narrative being in the details. There\u2019s a term for it, and it\u2019s a pejorative. It\u2019s called micromanager, and everyone\u2019s afraid to be accused of being a micromanager. I had this thought because a lot of founder mode came from me studying Steve Jobs. For 10 years, I was at wit\u2019s end. It wasn\u2019t my first instinct to copy Steve Jobs\u2019 leadership style, it was kind of a last resort. I didn\u2019t copy everything, but I copied a lot of how he organized and ran the company.\u00a0"]], [["A few weeks ago, I had dinner with his son, Reed Jobs, and I remember asking him what Steve\u2019s opinion of micromanagement was. He had such an interesting perspective. He said, \u201cSteve Jobs was in the details.\u201d He would skip levels, many levels, to be in the details, which somebody who goes to Harvard Business School would never do. He said he never felt like he was micromanaging because he was partnering with people on the details. I asked people like Jony Ive and [Hiroki Asai], who worked for Steve, and I said, \u201cDo you feel like Steve Jobs micromanaged you?\u201d And they said, \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t.\u201d"]], [["I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m a micromanager, maybe I\u2019m not. I think the distinction is that I remember one time an executive on my team asked, \u201cIs this your decision or is this my decision?\u201d And I remember saying, \u201cIt should never be either.\u201d And that\u2019s founder mode: it should never be either. It\u2019s never your decision, it\u2019s never my decision. We\u2019re in it together. If you\u2019re cofounders, whose decision is it? It\u2019s your decision together. It\u2019s the same thing hierarchically with the org chart.\u00a0"]], [["So, that\u2019s really what it means: great leadership is presence, not absence. It\u2019s in the details. What a lot of founders do is they let go of the product, and they abdicate responsibility. Frank Slootman wrote a book called Amp It Up where he basically said, \u201cTo turn a company around, the CEO just needs to set the pace of the company.\u201d You set the vision, but more important than the vision, you set the pace, you set the standards. And that\u2019s what founder mode is really about.\u00a0"]], [["By the way, you don\u2019t need to be a founder to do that. You can apply founder mode to government, you can apply founder mode to a nonprofit, to a volunteer organization, to being a sports coach. It just means the leadership is presence in the details, and it\u2019s not about being so-called autocratic because you\u2019re not telling the experts what to do. But you know what they\u2019re doing, and you\u2019re working through, and you\u2019re challenging them. And you should do this\u00a0 because, let\u2019s say you have 10 experts. They might disagree. Finance says this is the best outcome, but that may conflict with legal, which might conflict with product marketing, which represents the customer, which might conflict with engineering, which is the schedule. So, you have to weigh all these trade-offs. That\u2019s why you have to be in the details."]], [["Maybe one other thing before we wrap up.\u00a0"]], [["Oh, we\u2019re far from wrapping up. I just wanted to let you know."]], [["One tidbit I\u2019d like to say about hiring, just as a thought. One of the most important things I do is have an executive team. You could think of them as C-level or SVPs. There\u2019s about seven of them. Then, the next level are VPs, and there\u2019s maybe 30 of them or 40 of them. I don\u2019t really know how many there are."]], [["Something I do that\u2019s different from almost every other CEO in Silicon Valley (but I think [Nvidia CEO] Jensen Huang basically does this, Steve Jobs did this, Walt Disney did this, and Elon Musk did this) is I treat all the VPs as direct reports. Jensen got rid of the executive team. He just has 40 direct reports. That\u2019s a little unwieldy for me. I\u2019ve gone through that thought experiment of just having the VPs, and I can\u2019t track everything."]], [["But all VPs do a report. They report to me and to their executive, and I am the co-hiring manager. So instead of me hiring an executive, like a CFO who hires their people, I am the co-hiring manager. I do the kickoff, I\u2019m the second interview, and, ultimately, I decide the final compensation for all the top people in the company, not the managers. The managers give recommendations, and I make the final decision. This is just a very practical version of founder mode, of being in the details. You don\u2019t just hire and manage your executives, you skip-level and manage as many people as possible in a dual-reporting relationship."]], [["So, the branding of founder mode has offered you some narrative clarity. It\u2019s clear from the last time when we had a very similar kind of conversation that if I had to pull all of that back into what we\u2019re really describing here, into the Decoder framework, I would say what you were describing is fundamentally \u201cbe a functional organization, not a divisional organization.\u201d And that was the big change that you made the last time you were on the show. You\u2019ve since made other changes, right?"]], [["Yes."]], [["You just "], ["created this new role in the C-suite", "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/23/airbnbs-new-chief-business-officer-shares-his-top-priorities-for-hosts-and-travelers.html"], [", chief business officer.

How\u2019d you make that decision?"]], [["One thing about functional, and then I\u2019ll answer that question. I don\u2019t think all companies should be functional, but I think they should be as functional as they can get away with. That\u2019s the rule. [Andreessen Horowitz co-founder] Ben Horowitz "], ["had this saying", "https://a16z.com/taking-the-mystery-out-of-scaling-a-company/"], [": \u201cGive ground grudgingly.\u201d You should give ground grudgingly.

So I think you should give ground grudgingly, and that\u2019s the general philosophy."]], [["I just want to say one thing about being a functional organization. There is one very specific downside: The downside of the functional organization is you cannot do disparate things. But here\u2019s something I wanted to spell. It\u2019s not true you can\u2019t do as many things. It\u2019s not true that it would be a slower-run organization. We\u2019ve actually increased product development by being a functional organization, but we\u2019re like one flywheel. We can\u2019t create three other flywheels that are disparate. The only reason I believe a company should divisionalize is so that they could do truly disparate things that have disparate functional expertise. So, if we had a jet engine business, that\u2019s a different functional expertise.\u00a0"]], [["Now let\u2019s go to the business organization. At most companies, there is no function called \u201cbusiness.\u201d Maybe we can also call it revenue \u2014 business, revenue, commercial. There\u2019s different names: chief commercial officer, chief business officer, chief revenue officer. They all kind of mean the same thing. The reason most companies don\u2019t have this is because they have general managers, and the general managers play that role. The general managers are the mini-CEO and they own the business, and they usually partner with a finance person. Somewhere between the general manager and finance person, or maybe a data scientist, they\u2019re the business function."]], [["We found that the problem with that is, none of them are really experts in \u201cbusiness.\u201d When I mean business, I mean revenue, the business model, the market size, what are the kind of dynamics of this market? Like with Co-Host, what should we charge? Should this be a free service? Do we take a commission? How does this compare to third-party property management services? Which countries do we roll this out in? What are the economics by country? Is it a standard rate? There\u2019s just a lot of detailed questions one must answer."]], [["So, we decided to create a chief business organization with three functions. One is supply. Supply was always a function at Airbnb, but it was kind of conflated with international and general managers. So we said, \u201cNo, no. There are experts in getting supply of homes, experiences, and other things at Airbnb.\u201d"]], [["Then, we have a business function, which is quite literally the business counterpart to product marketing. If product marketing is nouveau product management, product marketing would be product management minus program management plus some outbound marketing, and it\u2019s fewer people. That\u2019s all it is. It\u2019s outbound-inbound in one role. They are really thinking about what the customer wants and what the experience should be like, but they\u2019re not in spreadsheets. They\u2019re not business model people.\u00a0"]], [["So they have a counterpart called the \u201cbusiness function.\u201d With Co-Host Network, for example, we had a business person looking at the business model for Co-Host, we had a product marketing person who understands what\u2019s the product, how are we going to market this, and why do people actually want this. Those two people have to go together. One reports to Hiroki \u2014\u00a0 it\u2019s product marketing, it\u2019s more creative. One reports to Dave Stephenson, the former CFO now chief business officer, and they\u2019re really the two parts of the continuum."]], [["Then, you have a supply person. The supply person \u2014 based on the business organization, the business model, and the product marketing brief \u2014 has to now go get supply. They work with international, the third group in the chief business officer org, to then take that playbook and bring it to all the different countries. And, of course, the product marketing has their own three-legged stool with design and engineering."]], [["But it\u2019s different from other companies where product really directs design. I don\u2019t like that, and I caused a bit of a storm at a Figma conference. Basically, I got taken out of context and people thought I said I fired all the product managers. What actually happened was that I got rid of the classic product management function, I reassigned the most senior product managers to be product marketers, and I reclassified most of the other product managers as program managers."]], [["By the way, most product managers in Silicon Valley aren\u2019t actually product managers. They\u2019re glorified program managers, but they\u2019re not even experts at program management. That\u2019s all they\u2019re doing; They\u2019re making sure the thing ships. That\u2019s program management, that\u2019s not product management. So, this is what we\u2019re doing. It\u2019s a very simple organization, and it\u2019s just a continuation of us being functional."]], [["It\u2019s funny that you say all this. If you asked my CEO, he would tell you that I scream that we should be divisional all the time because I think tech journalism is different from video game journalism and different from sports journalism, which is different from New York Magazine. At the end of the day, we all make one kind of thing, and there\u2019s reasons to have central teams, and there\u2019s reasons to share costs."]], [["Do you ever find yourself thinking, \u201cOkay, if I was in the other kind of organization, something else would be faster, I could make this tradeoff, but there would be a benefit to being in a more divisional structure?\u201d"]], [["I think it\u2019s really important to not be dogmatic and say functional is better than divisional, and I think it really depends on industries. In tech companies, functional is generally better because you can leverage shared technologies, everyone can row together, and you get economies of scale. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing that in your business."]], [["Okay, here are the two things \u2014 I said one, there\u2019s really two. There\u2019s two benefits to divisional. The first benefit is, you can do disparate things. We talked about that. . I\u2019m just thinking of an absurd thing: we want to create a podcasting division. It would be really hard for the people designing the app and the marketers advertising homes to think about podcasting. Now we want to create a TV series. That\u2019s really, really disparate, so we would struggle to do super-disparate things."]], [["The second downside to a functional organization is that it takes longer to start. Because if you want to just get something going, you need to get everyone organized. But everyone organized has a multi-year roadmap, so they now need to make room on the roadmap. So, for disparate things that you can start quickly, a divisional structure is better. Those, to me, are the primary advantages of a divisional structure. There\u2019s a theoretical third advantage, which is that you can hire so-called entrepreneurial-type people that don\u2019t fit into a functional organization, but that one I don\u2019t agree with. That\u2019s a bit of a rabbit hole, so I won\u2019t go there unless you want to ask about it.\u00a0"]], [["That being said, once you get rowing\u2026 think about a bunch of us in a boat, and we\u2019re rowing together. If there are 10 people in 10 boats, they can get going faster and they can go in different directions, but the 10-person boat is going to row faster than 10 one-person boats. So once you get going with the functional organization, what I basically tell people is it\u2019s harder to get something on the roadmap, but if it gets on the roadmap, we put the weight of the company behind it.\u00a0"]], [["I like that constraint. I like the constraint of anyone can\u2019t just do anything because now we\u2019re focused, now we\u2019re prioritized, now we only do things that are differentiated.

That\u2019s what Steve Jobs did at Apple, and that\u2019s what Walt Disney did at Disney, and that\u2019s what Elon Musk does at Tesla.

They don\u2019t want you to tell them what to do, but there\u2019s this assumption that control is a zero-sum game. Either I have the power, or you have the power.

But I did a couple golf lessons once, and I had a golf instructor who literally coached me on every single swing.

And you said, \u201cI\u2019m going to have to make so many decisions that I went to all my team and I said, \u2018Here are our principles. Trust me to use these principles, and this is how I\u2019m going to make decisions.\u2019\u201d Is that still the framework, that everyone just agrees on the core principles?"]], [["Pretty much.

What do I think is the right thing to do? That can sound very subjective, but actually, you would have thousands of inputs. So, that\u2019s essentially what I do.

I usually have my direct talk first because if I talk, you\u2019ll just agree with me, and then I\u2019ll make the final decision. Most of my final decisions are just agreeing.

But I\u2019m very engaged. I pull them in, and I create one shared consciousness.

That\u2019s thousands of hours. That\u2019s the equivalent. I don\u2019t spend 35 hours a week with most people, but there are many people that spend 10\u201320 hours a week in a room with me.

You\u2019ve talked about Apple a lot. They don\u2019t have Steve Jobs anymore, they don\u2019t have Jony Ive anymore. They have started a bunch of divisions to do all kinds of other things.

I\u2019ll wrap up with my view on Apple.\u00a0"]], [["I think Tim Cook has done an extraordinary job, especially given the cards he was dealt, right? What alternative was there? Steve died. I don\u2019t know the circumstances, but I think it was that he resigned in August and died in October, only eight weeks later. So there\u2019s only an eight-week window between resignation and he\u2019s not even there. It\u2019s not like Bezos retired, but he\u2019s the executive chair. I think that Tim Cook basically took Apple from $300 million to, whatever, $3 trillion, added more than 90 percent of the market cap, and it\u2019s done very, very well. He\u2019s a great operator."]], [["A couple things to say, though. Number one, just because Tim added $2.7 trillion in market cap and Steve added $300 billion doesn\u2019t mean that Tim did most of the work.

I don\u2019t think that any other product has generated more profit \u2014 maybe not more revenue, but more profit \u2014\u00a0 than the iPhone. The most successful company probably in the history of capitalism, or at least certainly the last 25 years. It\u2019s crazy when you think about it. Then ask yourself a couple other questions. Let\u2019s imagine Steve Jobs didn\u2019t die in 2011, he died in 2005, right when the iPod Video had just launched. Would they have come up with the iPhone? They might have.

But the technology industry... I mean, the word technology may as well be a synonym for the word change. We\u2019re in the change industry, and it is very, very dangerous to not be constantly changing. If you\u2019re a company that makes devices, the most important thing you need to do is make new tools and make new devices.\u00a0"]], [["I saw "], ["a Bloomberg report", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-10-06/when-will-apple-intelligence-be-released-when-is-apple-releasing-m4-macs-ipad-m1xksx7q"], [" that said Apple is moving away from launches, and moving more towards services. They\u2019re going more divisional. My unsolicited advice is that whenever Tim decides to retire, the next CEO should also be the chief product officer. I asked people, \u201cWho was the chief product officer at Apple when Steve was alive?\u201d Everyone said, \u201cSteve.\u201d It wasn\u2019t Phil Schiller.
