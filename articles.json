You can feel Eggers working to conjure an atmosphere of psychosexual dread, and you can see him using modern filmmaking techniques to create haunting visuals evocative of early 20th century cinema. Though it cleaves very close to the original while incorporating elements from other vampire classics, this Nosferatu puts far more focus on the interiority of its central heroine as she grapples with her deep-seated longing to be taken by an avatar of death."

Despite her constant feeling of being misunderstood, Ellen\u2019s days are filled with joy thanks to her realtor husband Thomas (Nicholas Hoult) and best friend Anna Harding (Emma Corrin).

The movie presents Ellen as the kind of woman who, even without her visions, would still feel smothered by the misogynistic social norms of her era. Ellen\u2019s powers are an innate part of who she is, as is the way they often send her into fits of moaning that, to onlookers, read as explicitly orgasmic.\u00a0"

But Nosferatu spells it out plainly as it first shows you how Transylvanian Count Orlok (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd) is the one calling out to her through their seemingly inexplicable telepathic connection. The mechanics of Ellen and Orlok\u2019s bond is another detail that Eggers has retooled just enough to make it work as a point of intrigue. It\u2019s obvious that this is a film about a vampire who wants to sink his teeth into an unsuspecting woman\u2019s flesh.

We can see that Orlok is orchestrating some kind of elaborate plan to insert himself into Ellen\u2019s life, but what\u2019s fun is the way none of the film\u2019s characters have any frame of reference cluing them in to the fact that they\u2019re dancing through the motions of a classic Dracula period piece like "

          "Contemporary horror movies about people who don\u2019t know standard horror movie beats are frustrating because they pull you out of the fantasy. Eggers previously worked around that by focusing his films on characters planted firmly in times when their fears of the surrounding world and their own feelings could give rise to creatures they had never seen before. This Nosferatu is doing something similar, but because its story stays so true to the original, it also feels like Eggers is encouraging you to appreciate it as a thoughtful remake rather than a film trying to reinvent vampires."

      [
        [
          "This becomes clearer as Nosferatu shows you more of Orlok\u2019s ability to project his shadow across Europe to menace Ellen with promises of untold pleasure. On a technical level, it\u2019s clear that Eggers is creating scenes that Murnau could have only dreamed of, but you also get the sense that this is exactly the kind of alarming energy that made Max Schreck\u2019s Orlok so frightening when he first appeared onscreen. To that end, this Nosferatu works hard to make you feel Orlok\u2019s presence more than it actually tries to show you what he looks like as his plans begin taking shape. He\u2019s lurking in Ellen\u2019s mind but also in Thomas\u2019 fears that he might not be able to satisfy his wife\u2019s needs."

Ellen vacillates between terror, shame, and arousal to make you feel exactly what kinds of designs Orlok has. And Thomas\u2019 guileless confusion when he encounters clearly supernatural things speaks volumes to Orlok\u2019s ability to misdirect his unsuspecting victims."

We\u2019ve seen Eggers work in black and white before, but the way Nosferatu frequently shifts into a near-monochromatic palette of blacks and blues is a brilliantly artful trick evocative of blood draining out of a face in fear. Those moments help make Nosferatu feel like a uniquely inspired presentation of vampires as beings of darkness. But beyond their aesthetic beauty, they also highlight the extent to which Eggers has crafted Nosferatu as a tribute to films from Murnau and Browning."

Its high-pitched growl was more akin to naturally aspirated V12 supercars of yore than the bigger-displacement V8 it replaced in the 570S.

Its hydraulic steering was extremely communicative, responsive, and busy, relaying every crease in the tarmac at all times \u2014 to the point of requiring a firm grip and faster than average hands \u2014 just the way any driving aficionado desires.

          "The best way I can describe the Steerswomen is as a wandering order of largely female natural philosophers. They observe, deduce, test, and share knowledge in a slow-motion, preindustrial world, and the way Kirstein lays out her prose and her characters encourages the same in the reader. Several times during the series, I formed conclusions that were not borne out by the evidence and had to discard them \u2014 and did not mind doing so because that was just\u2026 part of the process.\u00a0"

          "I read a lot of genre fiction, and I love a slow burn, so The Steerswoman fits the brief. But also I admire Kirstein\u2019s respect for the intelligence and wit of both her characters and her readers; she brings you along on the journey and trusts you to understand the people you\u2019re journeying with.

I will preorder and devour it when another book comes along. "
