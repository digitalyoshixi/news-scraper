As the Windows 10 update cliff approaches, it's worth asking: Is running \"unsupported\" Windows 11 a good way to keep an older but still functional machine running, especially for non-technical users?", "I've run Windows 11 on a fair amount of old hardware, including PCs as old as a late XP-era Core 2 Duo Dell Inspiron desktop. For the first couple of years, I ran it most commonly on an old Dell XPS 13 9333 with a Core i5-4250U and 8GB of RAM and a Dell Latitude 3379 2-in-1 that just barely falls short of the official requirements (both systems are also pressed into service for ChromeOS Flex testing periodically).", "But I've been running the 24H2 update as my main work OS on two machines. The first is a Dell Optiplex 3010 desktop with a 3rd-generation Core i5-3xxx CPU, which had been my mother's main desktop until I upgraded it a year or so ago. The second is a Lenovo ThinkPad X230 with a i5-3320M inside, a little brick of a machine that I picked up for next to nothing on Goodwill's online auction site.", "Both systems, and the desktop in particular, have been upgraded quite a bit; the laptop has 8GB of RAM while the desktop has 16GB, both are running SATA SSDs, and the desktop has a low-profile AMD Radeon Pro WX2100 in it, a cheap way to get support for running multiple 4K monitors. The desktop also has USB Wi-Fi and Bluetooth dongles and an internal expansion card that provides a pair of USB 3.0 Type-A ports and a single USB-C port. Systems of this vintage are pretty easy to refurbish since components are old enough that they've gone way down in price but not <em>so</em> old that they've become rare collectors' items. It's  to get a usable computer for $100\u2014or for free if you know where to look.", "And these systems were <em>meant</em> to be maintained and upgraded. It's one of the beautiful things about a standardized PC platform, though these days we've given a lot of that flexibility up in favor of smaller, thinner devices and larger batteries. It is <em>possible</em> to upgrade and refurbish these 12-year-old computers to the point that they run modern operating systems well because they were designed to leave room for that possibility.", "But no matter how much you upgrade any of these PCs or how well you maintain them, they will never meet Windows 11's official requirements. That's the problem.", "Depending on how you do it, it can be a minor pain to get Windows 11 up and running on a computer that doesn't natively support it. But once the OS is installed, Microsoft's early warnings about instability and the possible ending of updates have proven to be mostly unfounded.", "A Windows 11 PC will still grab all of the same drivers from Windows Update as a Windows 10 PC would, and any post-Vista drivers have at least a <em>chance</em> of working in Windows 11 as long as they're 64-bit. But Windows 10 was widely supported on hardware going back to the turn of the 2010s. If it shipped with Windows 8 or even Windows 7, your hardware should mostly work, give or take the occasional edge case.

You don't have to think about how you're running an unsupported operating system; Windows remains Windows. That's the big takeaway here\u2014if you're happy with the performance of your unsupported PC under Windows 10, nothing about the way Windows 11 runs will give you problems.", "There's one exception for the PCs I've had running unsupported Windows 11 installs in the long term: They don't want to automatically download and install the yearly feature updates for Windows.

Trying to run an upgrade install from within Windows just means the system will yell at you about the things your PC is missing.

It should also work for upgrading an older version of Windows 11 to 24H2.", "Having to go out of your way to keep Windows 11 up to date on an unsupported PC is a fairly major pain. But unless your hardware is exceptionally wretched (I wouldn't recommend trying to get by with less than 4GB of RAM at an absolute bare minimum, or with a spinning hard drive, or with an aging low-end N-series Pentium or Celeron chip), you'll find that decade-old laptops and desktops can still hold up pretty well when you're sticking to light or medium-sized workloads.", "I haven't found this surprising. Major high-end CPU performance improvements have come in fits and starts over the last decade, and today's (Windows 11-supported) barebones bargain basement Intel N100 PCs perform a lot like decade-old mainstream quad-core desktop processors.", "With its RAM and GPU updates, my Optiplex 3010 and its Core i5 worked pretty well with my normal dual-4K desktop monitor setup (it couldn't drive my Gigabyte M28U at higher than 60 Hz, but that's a GPU limitation). Yes, I could feel the difference between an aging Core i5-3475S and the Core i7-12700 in my regular Windows desktop, and it didn't take much at all for CPU usage to spike to 100 percent and stay there, always a sign that your CPU is holding you back. But once apps were loaded, they felt responsive, and I had absolutely no issues writing, recording and editing audio, and working in Affinity Photo on the odd image or two.", "I wouldn't recommend using this system to play games, nor would I recommend overpaying for a brand-new GPU to pair with an older quad-core CPU like this one (I chose the GPU I did specifically for its display outputs, not its gaming prowess). If you wanted to, you could still probably get respectable midrange gaming performance out of a 4th-, 6th-, or 7th-gen Intel Core i5 or i7 or a first-generation AMD Ryzen CPU paired with a GeForce RTX 4060 or 3060, or a Radeon RX 7600. Resist the urge to overspend, consider used cards as a way to keep costs down, and check your power supply before you install anything\u2014the years-old 300 W power supply in a cheap Dell office desktop will need to be replaced before you can use it with any GPU that has an external power connector.", "My experience with the old Goodwill-sourced ThinkPad was also mostly pretty good. It had both Secure Boot and a TPM, making installation and upgrades easier. The old fingerprint sensor (a slow and finicky swipe-to-scan sensor) and its 2013-era driver even support Windows Hello. I certainly minded the cramped, low-resolution screen\u2014display quality and screen-to-bezel ratio being the most noticeable changes between a 12-year-old system and a modern one\u2014but it worked reliably with a new battery in it. It even helped me focus a bit at work; a 1366\u00d7768 screen just doesn't invite heavy multitasking.", "That brings me to my biggest word of warning.", "If you want to run Windows 11 on an older desktop, one where the computer is just a box that you plug stuff into, the age of the hardware isn't all that much of a concern. Upgrading components is easier whether you're talking about a filthy keyboard, a failing monitor, or a stick of RAM. And you don't need to be concerned as much with power use or battery life.", "But for laptops? Let me tell you, there are things about using a laptop from 2012 that you don't want to remember.", "Three important dividing lines: In 2013, Intel's 4th-generation Haswell processors gave huge battery life boosts to laptops thanks to lower power use when idle and the ability to switch more quickly between active and idle states. In 2015, Dell introduced the first with a slim-bezeled design (though it would be some years before it would fix the bottom-mounted up-your-nose webcam), which is probably the single most influential laptop design change since the MacBook Air. And around the same time (though it's hard to pinpoint an exact date), more laptops  rather than using finicky, inconsistent third-party drivers, making PC laptop touchpads considerably less annoying than they had been up until that point.", "And those aren't the only niceties that have become standard or near-standard on midrange and high-end laptops these days. We also have high-resolution, high-density displays; the adoption of taller screen aspect ratios like 16:10 and 3:2, giving us more vertical screen space to use; USB-C charging, replacing the need for proprietary power bricks; and backlit keyboards!", "The ThinkPad X230 I bought doesn't have a backlit keyboard, but it <em>does</em> have a bizarre little booklight next to the webcam that shines down onto the keyboard to illuminate it. This is sort of neat if you're already the kind of person inclined to describe janky old laptops as \"neat,\" but it's not as practical.", "Even if you set aside degraded, swollen, or otherwise broken batteries and the extra wear and tear that comes with portability, a laptop from the last three or four years will have a ton of useful upgrades and amenities aside from extra speed. That's not to say that older laptops can't be useful because they obviously can be. But it's also a place where an upgrade can make a bigger difference than just getting you Windows 11 support.", "Windows 11's system requirements were controversial in part because they were  like TPM 2.0 modules, hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI), and mode-based execution control (MBEC). A TPM module makes it possible to seamlessly encrypt your PC's local storage, , while HVCI helps to isolate data in memory from the rest of the operating system to make it harder for malicious software to steal things (MBEC is just a CPU technology that speeds up HVCI, which can come with a hefty performance penalty on older systems).", "Aside from those specific security features, there are other concerns when using old PCs, some of the same ones we've discussed in macOS as Apple has wound down support for Intel Macs. Microsoft's patches can protect against software security vulnerabilities in Windows, and they can provide some partial mitigations for firmware-based vulnerabilities since even fully patched and fully supported systems won't always have all the latest BIOS fixes installed.", "But software can't patch everything, and even the best-supported laptops with 5th- or 6th-generation Core CPUs in them will be a year or two past the days when they could expect new BIOS updates or driver fixes.", "The PC companies and motherboard makers make some of these determinations; cheap consumer laptops tend to get less firmware and software support regardless of whether Intel or AMD are fixing problems on their ends. But Intel (for example) stops supporting its CPUs altogether  (support ended for 7th-generation CPUs in March). For any vulnerabilities discovered after that, you're on your own, or you have to trust in software-based mitigations.", "I don't want to overplay the severity or the riskiness of these kinds of security vulnerabilities. Lots of firmware-level security bugs are the kinds of things that are exploited by sophisticated hackers targeting corporate or government systems\u2014not necessarily everyday people who are just using an old laptop to check their email or do their banking. If you're using good everyday security hygiene otherwise\u2014using strong passwords or passkeys, two-factor authentication, and disk encryption (all things you should already be doing in Windows 10)\u2014an old PC will still be reasonably safe and secure.", "If you have a Windows 10 PC that is still working well or that you can easily upgrade to give it a new lease on life, <em>and</em> you don't want to pay whatever Microsoft is planning to charge for continued Windows 10 update support, installing Windows 11 may be the path of least resistance for you despite the installation and update hurdles.", "Especially for PCs that only miss the Windows 11 support cutoff by a year or two, you'll get an operating system that still runs reasonably well on your PC, should still support all of your hardware, and will continue to run the software you're comfortable with. Yes, the installation process for Windows' annual feature updates is more annoying than it should be. But if you're just trying to squeeze a handful of years out of an older PC, it might not be an issue you have to deal with very often. And though Windows 11 is different from Windows 10, it doesn't come with the same learning curve that switching to an alternate operating system like ChromeOS Flex or Linux would.", "Eventually, these PCs will age out of circulation, and the point will be moot. But even three years into Windows 11's life cycle, I can't help but feel that the system requirements could stand to be relaxed a bit. That ship sailed a long time ago, but given how many PCs are still running Windows 10 less than a year from the end of guaranteed security updates, expanding compatibility is a move Microsoft could consider to close the adoption gap and bring more PCs along.", "Even if that doesn't happen, try running Windows 11 on an older but still functional PC sometime.

The Pi's PCIe slot can only provide 5 W of power for external accessories, far short of the 75 W that a desktop graphics card would be able to get from a typical PCIe slot in a motherboard.

Nvidia's GPUs generally aren't really an option for projects like this because the open source drivers lag far behind the ones available for Radeon GPUs.", "Once various kernel patches were applied and the kernel was recompiled, installing AMD's graphics firmware got both graphics output and 3D acceleration working more or less normally.", "Despite their age and relative graphical simplicity, running\u00a0<em>Doom 3</em> or<em> Tux Racer</em> on the Pi 5's GPU is a tall order, even at 1080p.
